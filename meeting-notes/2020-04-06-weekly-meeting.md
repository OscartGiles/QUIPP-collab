Agenda
- CW20 wrap-up
- Review end of March milestone
  - Project board updated
- Next steps:	
  - CC-HIC update
    - Greg and Kasra to send application for access soon; will need to do some training to be able to use it
  - A period of writing/reflection seems like it could be useful at this point/perhaps included in the next milestone
    - Combine draft report (QUIPP-pipeline/doc) and Alison's working paper (Overleaf) into a single document
      - Include further knowledge on privacy (and other things)
      - This could turn into the current user guide, as well as contain draft material for some of the papers we discussed
    - Consider also writing a blog post based on CW20 work
- QUIPP-collab now open - thoughts on structure? E.g. migrating issues etc.
  - QUIPP-pipeline to become the primary project board (OS to move)
- Web front-end mini-demo
  - Use the schemas for validation
  - Front-end: to be explored at a later date
  - Related topic for future discussion, and to include in the working paper: How to best present information on the 
    methods and link to relevant material for these, as well as their associated configuration options.  How to present the
    various outputs in an understandable way?
