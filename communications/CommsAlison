Quantifying UncertaInty and Preserving Privacy in Synthetic Data Sets (QUiPP)

What is QUIPP (1)?

- a tool which quantifies the balance Of privacy and utility
- a better understanding of how uncertainty is propagated within a system
- consideration of privacy and uncertainty across multiple domain areas

What is QUIPP (2)?


Who is it for?
Organisations that will find this useful:
Universities —> doing research on ‘sensitive’ data sets


How is it going to do this?

Microsimulation to create synthetic populations
**This slide needs a diagram**

Privacy v Utility (1)

Diagram with the sliding bars

(Examples of where the balance has not been right)

Privacy v Utility (2)

How are we going to ensure privacy?  Looking at a bunch of methods.

Uncertainty

Example 1: Health Care

Example 2: Finance

Responsible AI (Ethics)

What QUIPP is NOT.

- Data provider
- Mock up of a tool

Who we would like to work with?

Anyone who has data that needs to be retain privacy (and be assured of this).

Github, website etc


What’s the project about?

Census 
Accessing, validating, getting value out of data 
Guidelines about how to use data properly (link up different pools of expertise, work flow to get more people to use the data). 
Technical robustness - sign in with one account and access data from other accounts.
Build data trust, good practice - open up access to the data.  Make the data super sensitive, less sensitive etc.
Trade off between utility and privacy preservation.  Have examples where these will be good and be bad.

Responsible AI - the more powerful the tehcnique the harder it is to check what’s going on inside - are the methods really working.

What about examples where people are truly unique?

Data structures - different implications.

How anoynmistion isn’t enough.

Example of where privacy preservation hasn’t worked.  


Uncertainty - where does 

Data types

Synthetic 
Individual to individual
Aggregate to individual
Individual to aggregate

Research questions 

How do we convert a 1% sample into a robust population?
How do we fine tune
