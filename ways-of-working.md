## Communication

You can reach members of the QUiPP team through their preferred communication methods:
- ...
- ...
- Louise: I'm usually around on Slack (`@louise`) and GitHub (`@LouiseABowler`), and you can also reach me via email.
- ...

We have a private group Slack channel, `#quipp`, in the Turing's Slack workspace.
The REG team members will generally be available there, but remember that not everyone will check Slack regularly.


## Project management with GitHub

### Issues

Our upcoming work should be described in issues.
As well as a description of a task, issues can contain updates on progress and questions and comments from the rest of the team.

If it is clear who will work on an issue, that person should be assigned to the issue.

Issues can be tagged so that we can see at a glance what type of work they describe.
Tags are particularly useful for issues of the following types:
- Datasets: These issues contain ideas for datasets. They can be closed when we gain access to the data, or when we decide not to use it.
- Events: Events that team members may be interested in attending. They can be closed after the event.

When completed, issues should be closed right away.
This can be done by pressing the "Close issue" button when viewing the issue, or by including, for example, "Closes \#1" in the description of a pull request which implements the feature requested in the issue.

### Project board

The four columns of the project board show our upcoming, current and completed work plans:
- Backlog: Ideas and actions that we will work on, but not right away.
- Upcoming: Issues that we will draw from when are ready to take on another task.
- In progress: Issues that we are currently working on. The relevant team member(s) should be assigned to the issue.
- Done: Issues which have been entirely completed or which won't be worked on.


## Zotero

We store relevant literature and notes in a shared [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) library, `SyntheticData`.
Contact Martin if you need an invite to the group.
Everyone in the team is encouraged to add interesting papers, blog posts and other resources to the library.

To avoid duplication of effort when reading, we have been tagging papers with our name as we read them and attaching short notes.
Tags and notes can be added by clicking on the name of the paper, then clicking on the appropriate button in the panel on the right.

We do not currently use tags or folders to organise papers by subject, but may rethink this as the library grows.
