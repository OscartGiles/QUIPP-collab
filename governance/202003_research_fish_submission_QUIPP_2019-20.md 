## Outcome categories

### Publications


### Collaborations & Partnerships

- Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust 
    - ...to evaluate whether synthetic emergency department admissions data can be used in place of highly sensitive real data in the development of algorithms to be incorporated into their emergency department triage app.
- University College London Critical Care Health Informatics Collaborative
    - ...to evaluate whether data synthesis techniques can generate privacy preserving versions of their critical care patient data.
- Kings College London SynaPSE project
    - ...on privacy preserving probabilistic modelling of content access patterns.
- University of Dundee
    - ...on evaluating sensitivity of ML models trained on sensitive data to determine if they can be safely shared outside of safe haven secure compute environments.
  

### Further Funding
- The benchmarking work undertaken by this project has resulted in the Turing partnering with Hazy Limited and the Financial Conduct Authority on a proposal to Innovate UK to develop an Interbank Collaborative Synthetic Data Platform (TS/T020067/1).
