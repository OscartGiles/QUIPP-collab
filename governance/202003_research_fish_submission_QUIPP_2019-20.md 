- Open development repository for the QUiPP benchmarking pipeline
    - Type: Software
    - Licence: Yes (Open Source)
    - Licence type: MIT license
    - Description: This is the public repository in which we are developing our benchmarking pipeline to provide tools to evaluate how well data synthesis methods preserve both individualsâ€™ privacy and the utility of datasets for analysis.
    - Year realised: 2019
    - Notable impacts: By developing our tools for analysing privacy and utility preservation in the open, we can more effectively collaborate with partner organisations and support others in the wider community in re-using our tooling as soon as we develop it and in extending it to cover the methods and use cases of most interest to them.
